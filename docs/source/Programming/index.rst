Programming
===================================

In order to make a computer game or just to  make tools supplementing other games,
it's necessary to learn programming.

Despite clear distinction between languages which people use to create different games,
most of them are really similar making a process of learning a 2nd language much shorter than a first one.
This may lead to a choice of first learning a simpler to learn language (like Python) before committing
to a more complex one with which we will finally start development of games.


Game Design Documents
------------

Most often developers referencing existing projects keep their complete design in back of their heads.
But that approach is prone to error and insufficient in larger development teams.

That's why it's common for a game to posses a "Game Design Document" [GDD]
that encapsulates whole design work in one place.

It's a good practise to split ever growing GDD into several files in order to improve readability.



Learning Game Design
--------

Throughout the history game development was unpopular field in comparison to other art forms. Which led to lack of
known research on the subjects. Most innovations fall to the most recent times after
the creation of computers.

That's why it may be better to approach game design as a completely new field.
The designer will have to learn from a wide range of subjects in order to
supplement poor knowledge base on creative process filling the game design work.

But first it's still useful to get accustomed with already made works in this field.
To the most widely popular research on game design we can account video essays published on youtube.
