Game Design
===================================

In order to make any game, first there has to be some underlying game design put in place.


Game Design Documents
------------

Most often developers referencing existing projects keep their complete design in back of their heads.
But that approach is prone to error and insufficient in larger development teams.

That's why it's common for a game to posses a "Game Design Document" [GDD]
that encapsulates whole design work in one place.

It's a good practise to split ever growing GDD into several files in order to improve readability.



Learning Game Design
--------

Throughout the history game development was unpopular field in comparison to other art forms. Which led to lack of
known research on the subjects. Most innovations fall to the most recent times after
the creation of computers.

That's why it may be better to approach game design as a completely new field.
The designer will have to learn from a wide range of subjects in order to
supplement poor knowledge base on creative process filling the game design work.

But first it's still useful to get accustomed with already made works in this field.
To the most widely popular research on game design we can account video essays published on youtube.


Time requirement to complete first project
--------
Unknown - complete lack of knowledge combined with under developed understanding of a finished piece,
makes it hard to sometimes differentiate between "caveman's sketch on the cave walls" and "polished masterpiece".

Because of that most often "good" game design is measured by it's uniqueness in relation to the already existing games.
At the same time, game being "fresh" and "unique" isn't enough as it firstly has to be "fun" to play, which is
highly subjective and requires game design to already be in some way "finished" as a standalone product to be tested.
